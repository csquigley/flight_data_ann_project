Flight Price Prediction Using an Artificial Neural Network

This goals of this project are to:
1. collect recent,relevant flight data and prices from a major flight booking website using Selenium
- Parsing data using regex
- Data collected will be written to a .csv file for later use
2. Construct an ANN capable of predicting on both continuous and categorical data
